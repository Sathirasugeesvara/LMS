This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have. By using our platform, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Personal information</h3>

      <h3>1.3 Device and technical data</h3>
      <p>We automatically collect certain technical information when you use the platform, including IP address, browser type/version, operating system, device identifiers, and pages visited.</p>

      <h3>1.4 Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
      <p>We use cookies and local storage to remember preferences, enable sessions, and analyze usage. You can disable cookies in your browser, but some features may not work correctly.</p>

      <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain your account and access to courses.</li>
        <li>To track learning progress, grade work, and issue certificates.</li>
        <li>To send important account notifications, updates, and support messages.</li>
        <li>To personalize content and recommend courses.</li>
        <li>To analyze usage and improve the platform.</li>
        <li>To protect against fraud and maintain security.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Legal bases for processing (if applicable)</h2>
      <p>If you are in a jurisdiction that requires it (for example, GDPR regions), we process personal data based on your consent, our contractual necessity to provide services, compliance with legal obligations, and our legitimate interests (improving the platform, security).</p>

        <li>Partners or institutions you choose to share data with (for example, your employer or school).</li>
        <li>Law enforcement or regulators when required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal data as long as your account exists and as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You can request deletion of your account and personal data (see section "Your rights").</p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data, including encrypted connections (HTTPS), secure servers, and access controls. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — if a breach occurs we will follow legal reporting requirements and notify affected users as required.</p>

      <h2>8. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>Our services are not directed to children under 13. If you are an institution enrolling minors, you agree you have the necessary parental consents. If you believe a child under 13 has created an account without consent, contact us to remove their information.</p>

      <h2>9. Third-party links and embedded content</h2>
      <p>Our platform may contain links or embedded content from third parties (video hosts, payment processors). We are not responsible for their privacy practices — please review the privacy policies of those services before sharing personal information.</p>

      <h2>10. International data transfers</h2>

      <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
